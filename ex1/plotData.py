# ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
# Instructions: Use plt.plot() to plot the data from example 1
#                in a scatter plot. The data is formatted in a
#                numpy array that is a list of [X, Y] pairs. Thus,
#                the first index refers to a pair list, and the 
#                second index on the array refers to either the X
#                or Y coordinate of the pair. Use the plt.xlabel
#                and plt.ylabel commands to provide axis labels
#                plt.show() at the end will return the plot you've
#                created.
#                
#
# Hint: You can use the 'rx' option with plot to have the markers
#       appear as red crosses. Furthermore, you can make the
#       markers larger by using plt.plot(..., 'rx', markersize = 10);
